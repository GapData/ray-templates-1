    "Ray Tasks are the simplest building block in Ray. They allow you to take a function that you've built on your local machine and scale it out to a cluster of machines, thus being able to run it in parallel extremely easily.\n",

    "## Getting Started with Ray Actors\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray Actors are much more sophisticated than Ray Tasks. Ray Actors maintain **state** on behalf of the user and allow distributed applications to modify that state through methods.\n",
